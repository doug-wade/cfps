# Reproducible error-resistant Javascript builds

Front-end javascript builds are becoming increasingly complicated, but not much
more reliable.  Learn how to improve the reproducibility of your front-end
builds and security of your application by using a monorepo to enforce best
practices.  Learn about lerna, the monorepo build tool that allows you to build
a full dependency graph as if it were a single node module; sinopia, the npm
registry you can run on-premise to keep your private code private, your public
code available during a registry outage, and to cache your build artifacts for
reproducible builds; and snyk, which allows you to audit and patch your code
against known vulnerabilities on every build.
