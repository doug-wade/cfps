# How the sausage is made

Now that the TC39 conducts their business out in the open, understanding how
javascript works from soup to nuts is possible.  Follow the lifecycle of a
proposal from an idea to a reference implementation to a stage 0 proposal all
the way through to its support in node.js and the browser.  We'll look at a
simple proposal, a conditional assignment operator from [formulation](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/proposing-a-conditional-assignment-or-equals-operator)
to [writing reference tests](https://github.com/doug-wade/conditional-assignment-tests)
and from [parsing](https://github.com/doug-wade/babylon/commit/8fc8b326f19840aba85b29fbad6e594366825da5)
to [code generation](https://github.com/doug-wade/babel/commit/b5f363bda4befd144ae7ed8e9fc08eef48c54dfb).
We'll talk about when to compile and when to polyfill, and learn about how you
too can shape the future of javascript.
