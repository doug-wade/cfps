Open sourcing react components

React components are small contained functions that take state as input and
produce markup as output, making them easy to reuse.  If you're looking for a
way to give back to the community, open-sourcing a react component is an
accessible way.  I'll explain how to set up your dependencies to avoid duplicate
react errors, setting up unit testing with ava and enzyme, visual testing with
storybook, static analysis with eslint and flow and continuous integration with
travis.  I'll also talk about setting up your project to make it easy for new
developers to contribute including setting up your documentation as a github
static site.
